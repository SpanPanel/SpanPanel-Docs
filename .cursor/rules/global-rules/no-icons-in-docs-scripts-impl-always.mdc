# No Icons in Documentation, Scripts, or Implementation Files

## Critical Rules

- MUST NOT use icons, emojis, or special characters in documentation, scripts, or implementation files unless specifically directed by the user
- MUST use clean, professional language without visual embellishments in all code and documentation
- MUST avoid decorative elements like 🎉, ✅, ❌, 📁, 🔧, etc. in print statements, comments, or documentation
- MUST maintain professional tone suitable for production environments and automated systems
- MUST only use icons/emojis when explicitly requested by the user in their instructions

## Examples

<example>
  # Professional output without icons
  print("Migration test completed successfully!")
  print("Check /tmp/span_migration_test_config.yaml for the full configuration")
  print("The v2 migration process appears to be working correctly")
  
  # Clean documentation
  ## Summary
  The script validates the migration process and generates test configurations.
</example>

<example type="invalid">
  # Using icons without being requested
  print("🎉 Migration test completed successfully!")
  print("📁 Check /tmp/span_migration_test_config.yaml for the full configuration")
  print("✅ The v2 migration process appears to be working correctly")
  
  # Decorative documentation
  ## 🎯 Summary
  The script validates the migration process and generates test configurations.
